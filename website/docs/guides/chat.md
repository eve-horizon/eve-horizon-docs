# Chat & Conversations

Eve connects agents to messaging platforms through the chat gateway. Configure routing rules to dispatch conversations to the right agents.

## Chat providers

Eve supports Slack, Nostr, and WebChat providers out of the box.

## Routing rules

Define routes in `.eve/chat.yaml` to map channels, users, or patterns to agents or teams.

## Threads

Conversations are tracked as threads with continuity across messages and coordination between agents.
