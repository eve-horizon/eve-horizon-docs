# Skills & Skill Packs

Skills are portable instructions that agents use to perform specialized tasks. They're defined in `SKILL.md` files and distributed via skill packs.

## Installing skills

List skill sources in `skills.txt` or use `x-eve.packs` in your manifest.

## Creating a skill

Write a `SKILL.md` file with the skill name, description, and instructions.

## Skill packs

Skill packs bundle multiple skills for distribution. They can be local directories or remote Git repositories.
