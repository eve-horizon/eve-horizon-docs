# Threads & Coordination

Threads track conversations across messages, agents, and platforms. They enable continuity and coordination in multi-agent workflows.

## Thread types

- **Chat threads** — conversations with users
- **Coordination threads** — inter-agent communication
- **Supervision threads** — oversight and approval flows

## Thread keys

Threads are identified by composite keys that include provider, channel, and message identifiers.

## Continuity

Agents maintain context across thread messages, enabling multi-turn conversations and long-running tasks.
